          <p className="text-lg">
            Slides have been a part of peopleâ€™s lives, whether for academic,
            business, or personal presentations. With our love for creating
            slides, we could not just hide them from the crowd. <br /> <br />
            Not only do slides educate, but they can also entertain us. Hence,
            we have created a platform to share our slides with the rest of the
            world! Moreover, we also want others to showcase their proudly-made
            slides. <br /> <br />
            Join us in our journey in creating and spreading more knowledge and
            happiness through Slide Depot!
